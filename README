novena-usb

Test power and overcurrent control for internal and external ports on Novena.

Heavily based on hub-ctrl.

To list port status, run with "-l".

When enabling or disabling a port, you need to describe the port you're
referring to.  A port descriptor is a letter+number combination.  The letter
must be 'i' for internal or 'e' for external, and the number must be 1-4.

For example, to enable internal ports 3 and 4, run:
    novena-hub -e i3 -e i4
